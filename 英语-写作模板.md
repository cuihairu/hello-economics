Under practical pressure, I became depressed and anxious that I had never felt. After a period internal adjustment, I decided to open a Taobao store on the Internet. With hard work and careful study, my business began to pick up and became better and better after half a year.

###  养成好的习惯

#### How to keep good habits

How to keep good **habits**? I always have a kind of procrastination. Maybe everyone's growth environment is different. Until I come across something, I deeply understand the importance of forming good **habits**!

Let me share a little story. One Monday, the leader told me that I would make a planning plan for him before Friday. Before going to bed at night. I confidently cheered myself on and determined to finish the plan tomorrow. But the next day, I found that I had no idea about writing the plan. My resistance immediately overturned the agreement I made last night and didn't start writing until Thursday night. I also encountered many problems during my writing. I also called my colleagues to ask questions, which disturbed others' rest and left a bad impression.

In fact, it is not difficult to submit this plan. I think we can first set ourselves a minimum and most easily achievable goal, and persist in cultivating new **habits** and saying goodbye to procrastination.

### 科技发展

#### virtual and reality

When it comes to the application of advanced technology. I have no right to speak, because I am a travel agency employee. My daily job is to make outbound travel quotations in Excel. However, after experiencing the COVID-19 epidemic, I still want to take this opportunity to express my thoughts.

After the epidemic, our overseas tourism industry has never recovered, and many customers are unable to travel abroad. Our company's technical personnel developed a software for tourism VR. It can be installed on computers and mobile phones, or you can even use it directly on the Internet. It is very fast and convenient!

But there are also problems. Watching it will make people dizzy, and serious people will have nausea reactions. It seems that there 1s a risk that is not conducive to health.

There is no denying in saying that advanced technology has been integrated into our study and life. Admittedly, this great invention, as a major means of entertainment that relieves one's pressure, boredom, stress and burden, adds some flavor of fun into our seemingly tedious, routine and monotonous life. But we also need to pay attention not to overuse, which will affect our health.

#### Discuss the impact of technological advancements on modern society. Are there any potential drawbacks? Provide examples to support your argument.

Technological advancements have profoundly transformed modern society, enhancing efficiency, communication, and access to information. Innovations such as the internet, smartphones, and artificial intelligence have revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact. For instance, remote work has become possible, enabling greater flexibility and productivity.

However, these advancements also present potential drawbacks. One significant concern is the loss of privacy, as digital technologies often involve the collection and use of personal data. Additionally, the rise of automation and AI may lead to job displacement, particularly in industries reliant on manual labor. While technology brings numerous benefits, it is essential to address these challenges to ensure that technological progress serves the broader good of society.

科技进步深刻地改变了现代社会，提高了效率、沟通和信息获取。互联网、智能手机和人工智能等创新革命性地改变了我们的生活、工作和互动方式。例如，远程工作已经成为可能，提供了更大的灵活性和生产力。

然而，这些进步也带来了潜在的缺点。一个重要问题是隐私的丧失，因为数字技术通常涉及个人数据的收集和使用。此外，自动化和人工智能的兴起可能会导致工作岗位的流失，特别是在依赖手工劳动的行业中。尽管科技带来了许多好处，但必须解决这些挑战，以确保科技进步服务于社会的整体利益。

### 环境保护  

#### Environmental Protection and Urban Ecology

Environmental problems are becoming more and more serious all over the world. Cars have made the air unhealthy for people to breathe and poisonous gas is given off by factories. Trees have been cut down and waste water is being poured into river.

There is a personal story to share with you. When I visited a city in Shandong province last year, I noticed lot of smoke rising from aluminum processing plant, whose waste water polluted the land, making it impossible to plant crops.
This experience shocked me and make me realize the signification of environmental protection.

When I went back, I take many measures to stop pollution from myself. I took the subway when I commuting. I stop using disposable plastic bags when I shopping. I use both sides of paper when I working. I do not waste water when I washing.

The earth is our home and we have the duty to take care of it. We don ’t need to do big things, but we can start out small, I hope the problem will be solved in the near future and our home will become better and better.

#### Write an essay on the importance of environmental protection and suggest some measures that individuals can take to contribute to a greener world.

Environmental protection is crucial for maintaining the health and sustainability of our planet. As human activities increasingly impact the environment, issues such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change have become more pressing. Protecting the environment is essential not only for preserving biodiversity but also for ensuring the well-being of future generations.

Individuals can contribute to environmental protection in several ways. Firstly, reducing waste by recycling and reusing materials can significantly decrease pollution. Secondly, conserving energy by using energy-efficient appliances and reducing water usage helps mitigate the effects of climate change. Lastly, supporting and participating in local environmental initiatives, such as tree planting and clean-up drives, fosters a collective effort towards a greener world. By taking these steps, each person can play a part in creating a sustainable future.

环境保护对维持地球的健康和可持续性至关重要。随着人类活动对环境的影响日益增加，污染、森林砍伐和气候变化等问题变得更加紧迫。保护环境不仅对保护生物多样性至关重要，也对确保后代的福祉具有重要意义。

个人可以通过多种方式为环境保护做出贡献。首先，通过回收和重复使用材料来减少废物，可以显著减少污染。其次，通过使用节能电器和减少用水量来节约能源，有助于缓解气候变化的影响。最后，支持和参与本地的环保活动，例如植树和清洁行动，可以促进集体为一个更环保的世界而努力。通过采取这些步骤，每个人都可以为创造一个可持续的未来贡献力量。

### 教育改革

Educational reform is vital for shaping the future of a country by equipping its citizens with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in a rapidly changing world. A robust educational system fosters innovation, economic growth, and social cohesion. Currently, many educational systems emphasize rote learning over critical thinking and creativity, which may not adequately prepare students for the challenges of the modern workforce.

Improvements could include incorporating more project-based learning, which encourages problem-solving and collaboration. Additionally, integrating technology into the classroom can provide students with access to a wealth of information and learning tools. Focusing on teacher training and development is also crucial to ensure that educators can effectively guide and inspire their students. By implementing these reforms, education can become a powerful catalyst for national development and prosperity.

教育改革对于塑造一个国家的未来至关重要，因为它能使公民具备在快速变化的世界中茁壮成长所需的技能和知识。一个强大的教育体系促进创新、经济增长和社会凝聚力。目前，许多教育体系强调死记硬背，而不是批判性思维和创造力，这可能不足以准备学生应对现代职场的挑战。

改进措施包括更多地采用项目式学习，鼓励解决问题和协作。此外，将技术融入课堂可以为学生提供丰富的信息和学习工具。重点加强教师培训和发展也是至关重要的，以确保教育工作者能够有效地引导和激励学生。通过实施这些改革，教育可以成为国家发展和繁荣的强大催化剂。

### 中国传统文化

Preserving traditional Chinese culture is essential for maintaining national identity and passing on rich historical and cultural heritage to future generations. In the modern world, globalization and rapid technological advancements pose challenges to cultural preservation, making it even more important to safeguard these traditions.

Promoting cultural heritage among the younger generation can be achieved through education and engagement. Schools should incorporate traditional arts, music, and history into their curricula to foster appreciation from an early age. Additionally, leveraging social media and digital platforms can make cultural content more accessible and appealing to young people. Organizing cultural events, such as festivals and workshops, also provides interactive and immersive experiences. By taking these steps, we can ensure that traditional Chinese culture continues to thrive in contemporary society.

保护中国传统文化对于维护民族认同和将丰富的历史文化遗产传承给后代至关重要。在现代世界中，全球化和快速的技术进步给文化保护带来了挑战，使得保护这些传统变得更加重要。

在年轻一代中推广文化遗产可以通过教育和参与来实现。学校应该将传统艺术、音乐和历史纳入课程，从小培养学生的文化欣赏。此外，利用社交媒体和数字平台可以使文化内容更容易获取并吸引年轻人。组织文化活动，如节日和工作坊，也提供了互动和沉浸式的体验。通过采取这些步骤，我们可以确保中国传统文化在当代社会中继续繁荣。
